    So far:
    
    1) We have built the API for getting a user registered.
    2) Server structure is ready.
    3) All dependencies have been added.
    4) Schemas are ready.
    5) $http requests are ready to take data to send it to Mongo Lab.
    6) Connection is running well.
    
    Work To Do:
    
    1) Connect the frontend with the backend now.
    2) Registration form should send all the data to server using $http post request.

    The above part is quite simple, just calling the API of findOne request, there are two methods of 
    getting the data from database:
             1) get request using find() method         (returns whole collection)
             2) post request using findOne() method     (returns specific data)
             
             
  Note:
             
     Here if(data==null) means that username is not found, so this will send me a null value in the
     response to the controller where I have called this Api. There I have put a code to see if it's null
    (meaning no username) so prompt an error that 'username not found'. (Please see loginCtrl in controller.js)

   Profile Member is used to get the current member all data by sending it's id from profileController.js
   and retrieving data there.
   
   Question & Answer:
   
   Q) Why didn't I use loginMember Api for this purpose, it is also bringing all the data?
   Ans) Yes, I could have used loginMember Api for bringing a specific member data but there has been a problem
        that I have to send username into the login Api because login is checked with username ofcourse,
        where profile Api needs to have a unique id to get the data from database, reason is that user can 
        change it's username anytime from profile page so how could username be a unique one, it is updating
        on user's choice so Api could have generate error that username not found because before updating
        I am asking a database to give me the username all details which is ofcourse an error. 
        _id is something which is unique and user cannot change it so it is fixed for each data and yet helps
        us in bringing the appropriate data.

 Here we have used the Api for jobsTotal in which simple data is being taken and saved into the schema, same as we are doing above in members registration 
 and login APIs. 
 
 Note:
 One thing really made me stressed and it was saving an Array of objects into Mongo. It was an easy task well but I haven't done that before so it took me 
 a while to figure it out that how it actually works. So please note that if we want to save an array of objects like we want to have a jobs array 
 with multiple objects of different jobs list containing label, number, data. So in schema.js we have made a simple array conatining objects of String 
 type. And same array is made in the boatController so that it is easy for us to just send a similar array with similar objects name and with same
 data type to Mongo. 
 Like here in schema we have Array 'jobs' and from controller we are sending Array 'allJobs'. Both the arrays are same so it is very easy now to send
 an array of objects. Happy Coding!

  the data. 
  
  Explanation:
  
  1) .limit(1) is a mongo function which restricts the response
  data to be only single entry or single object.
  
  2) sort() simply sorts the data with whatever condition 
  we send into the parameter.
  
  3) We are passing "$natural:-1" for the sorting so basically
  this method makes the array sorted with respect to time
  stamp which we have send in the latestUpdate data field.
  
  4) Note here that we are not telling the API to sort the data 
  with respect to the "latestUpdate" field but automatically
  $natural:-1 figures out the time stamp and sort the data.
  
  5) .exec is just to pass the function with error and data
  same like we do in other APIs but there we dont have to use the 
  exec but we directly pass the function. Here we needed the
  .exec for the function.
