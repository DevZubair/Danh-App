    Below is the code which you have written, well all the work you have done was perfectly right but you just made the small spelling mistakes. You can
    see the 'revert file' settings in cloud9 where you can see the video of how and what changes I have made. You called the ng-model with a separate 
    name whereas you made the $scope variable in the controller with the different name. This has caused the problem.

    Here above I have used ng-class and used a scope variable which I have made in stepsController, please see. Initially property is set to button-dark,
    but on ng-click I have set the buttonClass value to button-balanced which than binds the value to the class and hence button will become
    green. It is a sign that page is unlocked. Further we will maintain this with database properly.

     I have done a addition here by calling a function unlockNextPage() with a parameter stepsAbout, basically I am trying to use a single API
     for the update to make our code more robust.
