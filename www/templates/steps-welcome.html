    Below is the code which you have written, well all the work you have done was perfectly right but you just made the small spelling mistakes. You can
    see the 'revert file' settings in cloud9 where you can see the video of how and what changes I have made. You called the ng-model with a separate 
    name whereas you made the $scope variable in the controller with the different name. This has caused the problem.
