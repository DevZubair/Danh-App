          <b>Now Let's Look at "Quiet Incomes"</b>

          <b>Active Incomes</b> are incomes that we have to go out to actively create, spending our TIME and ENERGY in exchange for money.
          
          <b>Passive incomes</b> on the other hand are systemized incomes that can run on their own with little involvement on your part to maintain.  Hence, they will not drain you of your TIME and ENERGY and yet continue to earn you income.

          <b>Passive Incomes Are Partially Automated Cashflow Systems</b><br><br>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Passive Incomes are trickier to learn and set up. </li> 
            <li>They are not formally taught in schools.</li>
            <li>We have to go out of our way to learn how to create them.</li> 
          </ul><br>
          
          These extra hassles are the reason why most of us either don't know they exist, or are too lazy to learn more about them.  Hence, most of us don't have any passive incomes.<br><br>  
          
          Passive Incomes also often times  require a lot of money to set up .  So you not only have to learn on your own, but you also have to have the money to set it into motion.  Hence, most of us were never able to have the money to invest into creating passive incomes.<br><br>
          
          But if you find that you're often too tired or too busy to enjoy your life because you're always working... then a "Quiet Income" may be the answer you're looking for.<br><br>
