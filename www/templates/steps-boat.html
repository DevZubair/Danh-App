          To prepare yourself for your Journey into this new world, you must first build your <b>Boat</b>.<br><br> 
          <span class="subtitle">"Why Do I Need A Boat?"</span><br><br>
          Your <b>Boat</b> will act as your own "little bookkeeper".  It will track your own progress throughout the App and make managing your Life a bit more fun.<br><br>
          How well you BUILD your <b>Boat</b> will determine whether your boat sinks or floats.<br><br>
          How well you UPGRADE your <b>Boat</b> will determine how fast you achieve your milestones.

          We all start out with a <b>Row Boat</b> that we have to power with our own body and sweat, rowing the paddles.  Somewhere along the way, the Rich and Wealthy figured out that they must purchase Engines to power their boats, so they move forward faster.<br><br>
          Unfortunately, the rest of us failed to realize this and stuck to paddling our Row Boat until we're OLD.<br><br>
          The lessons ahead are designed to show you how you must also learn to use Engines to power your Boat if you want financial independence.<br><br>
          When you are ready, your Mentors will help you. In the end, we all want to be cruising along Life in our <b>Yachts</b>. But that's getting ahead of ourselves.
