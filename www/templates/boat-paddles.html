        The easiest way to power your boat is by using the Paddles and rowing it yourself.  So in essence You provide the Boat with <b>{{firstName}} Power</b>.<br><br>
        So {{firstName}}, you are <b>Rowing Your Boat</b> if you have a job or profession with an <span style="color:green">ACTIVE INCOME</span>.<br><br>
        In this section, enter all your jobs and estimate how much you earn per month for each to calculate your Paddle Power.

        Below we can see that simply a ng-repeat is used for making the list of lines of jobs and it can be incremented as soon as user hits the
        add line button and addJobsList() function is called which we have seend in boatController.js
        
        Note:
        Please see that ng-model is taking the data and I have used jobList.jobsLabel and jobList.jobsNumber so we won't be wrong if we say that 
        it is the pleasure of using Angular that it automatically makes a new object and saves the data by indexes. We just have to write ng-repeat
        and all the magic is done by Angular itself. Now on each add Line button click, the data of the previous line is saved on index 0 and than new
        data on index 1 waits for the new data. So we don't really had to write a long code for that.

            Your css is correct but it's not a good practice to use inline-css, its more good to use css classes properly. I have converted your inline
            css into class jobsClass and it is called on <div> tag below. Secondly please see style.css and check how I have made this class "jobsClass".
            
            Tip:
            
            There are some methods to use css classes. Few are:
            1) >
                This greater than sign ">" is use if we want to call a class on a child of any tag. Here jobsClass is in parent div and 
                jobsClass > input means that class will be called at first input tag.
                
            2) ~
                This tilda sign "~" is used if we want to call a class on sibling or we can say adjacent one. Here I have called jobsClass as 
                jobsClass > input ~ input, this means that second input will have this class.
