      Please note above that I have written members.chats in the ui-sref and not specifically written members
      here in the ui-sref. There is a reason:
      
      -> Concept:
      Always remember that we can not access to a parent state directly using ui-sref or any href. Parent states
      are not accessed directly and if we do so than an error is generated "Cannot transition to abstract state".
      So that's why I have accessed to any child state and automatically all the childs are covered with the 
      parent layer. Hope you understand this. I'll share a link on elance for more.-->

       Here I have removed the ion-nav-view tag which you have put for login, because as I have mentioned
        earlier in the routing section that you don't need to have different views for login, register becuase
        we want these pages to be accessed from front page.
