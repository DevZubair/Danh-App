     Well the above code we have written is basically cordova camera plugin own code. There are multiple options available for it like saving
     the taken picture to own gallery or not etc etc. I have put all the code in "deviceReady" function because this code will prompt an 
     error on browser as browser don't know anything about the plugins. deviceReady means that when this app is deployed on any real device
     (not browser, not emulator) than this code will run.
     
     Later we will send the URL of the image to mongoDB so that we can bring the data on profile of current user along with profile picture.
     
     There are some quick tips regarding the cordova camera plugin, there are two methods to save our image in our database. One is making it a 
     file (usually called FILE URL) and another is Base 64 image url. I have used Base 64 always so I have used the same here as well because for 
     file we have to install another plugin and code will be more big. I am still not very much clear of the difference that why people use
     FILE instead of Base 64 or why to use Base 64 instead of FILE Url.

        Logic : 
        
        I have put an if and else condition here which might you find a bit confusing. Let me explain. 
        Basically there are two conditions when User wants to update his/her profile.
        
        1) Keep the username same and update other fields.
        2) Change the username as well as other fields.
        
        Explanation:
        
        1) For the first condition, I have used "if" statement in which I am checking that if username is same
        as the database one, than it means that user  is keeping his/her username same so after it I just
        normally provided a check for password and update Api is called with no worries.
        
        2) For the second condition, "else" statement is working in which I have put a little logic behind it.
        I called another Api first which was getting a particular member by sending it's username to the 
        database which we have seen previously in login controller. 
        Reason for this is that we need to check that either the new username is already presented in the
        database or not (just like we have checked in the registration form). 
        
        Quick Notes:
        
        -> if(data) means that username is present and data is being responsed from the server so we provided
            an alert prompting error for user not available.
            
        -> else if(password query.........) means that username is not presented in the database so a user can
            use his/her new username but than a simple password check is again provided to see the authentication.
        
        -> After all this, update Api is called (/api/editProfile) in which data will be updated and user will get
            a prompt that data is successfully updated.

  Quick Overview:
  
  1) We setup the required $scope variables for all fields
  2) Get the data from database 
  3) Linked the $scope variable with data from database to show the textboxes already filled with old values
  4) Password is not showing because security reasons to make our app reliable
  5) Called the editProfile Function on submit button click
  6) First checked that either username is changed or not.
     -> If changed, checked for the availability
     -> If unchanged, directly updated the data
  7) Secondly checked for the old Password which should be correct to update the info
  8) If authentication is correct, data will be updated.
  9) _id is the unique id generated by MongoDB itself for each data in a collection
